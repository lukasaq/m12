Build a data table that aggregates on domains found in DNS requests on the CDA Corp network.  


1. Create a new data table within the Visualization page in Kibana.


2. Set the time picker to the correct timeframe.


3. Run the following query to limit the search to all DNS records. 


event.dataset:dns



This query searches for all the Zeek DNS logs over the defined timeframe. The event.dataset field contains values that indicate the protocol detected by Zeek in each network event. By searching for dns, all search results are limited to DNS events only.


5. Use a Count aggregation with a Terms bucket, splitting on the field dns.highest_registered_domain.keyword.

Run the following query on the Discover tab to limit your search to all DNS events that queried the suspicious domain:


dns.query.name:*faceb00k.com
